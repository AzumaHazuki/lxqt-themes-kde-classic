# lxqt-themes-kde-classic
This repository houses the LXQt port of KDE 3.5.10/Trinity DE's default theme, as well as a matching palette, a DE-agnostic blue SVG wallpaper, and an Openbox theme that tries its very hardest within the constraints of its own engine to mimic the default Plastik window decoration.

With this suite of themes installed, it should be possible to have a modern desktop with a very close experience to the good old days of KDE 3.5.x again. In keeping with the old style, it is recommend to use a skeumorphic icon theme like Oxygen or Elementary-KDE-Blue.
